    <p>My name is Faisal Fiaz. I have done my Bachelor in Computer Science from Pakistan.
        During my studies, in Pakistan, I worked as Network and Database. In my BS project I developed ‘Food Chains ‘Online Help System Using Web Android Base Application.
        Where I used Java, C++, Andriod for this project. During my studies I did internships as Network and Database Administrator at GCA solutions. Where my job tasks were to develop, set-up and maintain the company's computer networks, including intranet and Internet networks.
        There I got interest in Linux and networking.  After my graduation, I got opportunity to work with <a href="http://icawgames.com" target="_blank">ICAW</a> IT Solutions, a leading Game development company where I worked as game developer.
        I worked there for two years. We worked in team in Agile work flow, where I got opportunity to work with designing, developing, testing.
        I chose Uppsala university as my Master in Computer science after consultation with my professors from university and brother as they have very interesting up-to-date curriculum.

    <p>Hi. My name is Hamid Kisha. I am from Sudan. I have a working experience in mobile networks, mainly 2G and 3G systems. My bachelor degree was in electrical and electronics engineering. I had the chance to learn the fundamentals of computer science in the college when I studied Pascal, assemebly and C programming languages. I am using edx and coursera – the famous online learning platforms – to expand and sharpen my knowledge of computing. I hope after completing this master program to work as a software developer in one of the software giants before I build my own company.
